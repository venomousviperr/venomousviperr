- I cuddle freely if your status says so , and I also recommend to whisper to interact so I can see your messages.
  
                              ᡕᠵデᡁ᠊╾━ - - - you can use my ponies as inspiration freely, but do not copy.

                              . . . do not interact : tadc , forsaken , dod , helluva boss/hazbin hotel ..
                              
  - I don't usually approach large groups of people, but I can here and there.
  - I make it very obvious when I don't want to be around certain people.
- Don't feel obligated to start a conversation! I'm usually offtab and will respond late. :)
- Please do not interact if you like any of the things I put in my DNI list (in my carrd and in here), I do not like the community at all. While it may not be directed towards you, I tend to avoid people in my DNI list.
  - I also don't really enjoy conversations that turn inappropriate. I can handle a lot of jokes and humor, but I will eventually stop talking if the conversation goes off the rail.
- Overall, don't be afraid to approach me! Aside from my DNI list, I'm easy to talk to and I'm very social!
